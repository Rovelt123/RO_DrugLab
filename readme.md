I AM ONLY OFFERING SUPPORT TO MY CUSTOMERS THAT BOUGHT ONE OF MY SCRIPTS

Hello,

This is a free lab script as you know - I also made a paid version, with much cooler features, This is just a basic version of my paid lab script. 

I've made this script to my lib as well, so you have to download or convert this. Otherwise this is pretty much drag'n'drop :P
Here's the link for my lib:
https://github.com/Rovelt123/RO_Lib

(I'd appreciate a like and feedback on my discord<3)

I just created some easy quick emotes. If you want to redo them or make some yourself, you can use TGIANN Attach prop to player tool:

If you want to make more labs, you can do that as well! :D
